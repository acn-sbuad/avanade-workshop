# Azure Functions Workshop


Welcome to this Azure Functions workshop. You will be solving three tasks that will 
guide you in developing Azure Functions with HTTP trigger, Cosmos DB trigger and a timer trigger.



## Prerequisites

1. [Azure Functions Core v4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cwindows%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
    - To confirm installation, type `func -v` in a terminal. The output should be a version number in the following format `4.X.X`.
2. [.Net 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
    - To confirm installation type `dotnet --version` in a terminal. The output should be a version number in the following format `6.X.X`.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. [Azure Functions extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
    - To confirm installation, look for the following installed installations in the extensions tab in VS Code: Azure Account, Azure Functions, Azure Resources.
5. [C# extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) 
    - To confirm installation, look for C# in the extensions-tab in VS Code.
6. (Optional) An active Azure account. Create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free)

We recommend that a folder is created to contain all of the function created in the workshop.


## Setting up a development environment

1. Create a folder that will contain all of the functions created in the workshop
e.g. `learning-functions`
2. Open Visual Studio Code and open the newly created folder by selecting `Open folder` in the `File` menu.

We will now be connecting VS Code to your Azure Account
    
3. In the side menu select the Azure icon and click `Sign in to Azure...` in the `Resources` section. 

![Log onto Azure in VS Code](images/vs-code-log-onto-azure.png)

Follow the instructions to sign in to your account.

Congratulations, you are now ready to start developing your first Azure functions!

## Task 1 - Creating an Azure Function with an HTTP trigger

### Set up the Azure Function App
The Azure Functions extension in VS Code lets you create a function app project, along with your first function.

1. In VS Code, under the `Workspace` section of the Azure extension, select `Add` and `Create Function`.

    ![Create project](images/add-in-azure-extension.png)


2. You will now be given the option of creating a function project, select yes. 

![Create project prompt](images/create-project-prompt.png)

Going forward you will not be prompted for configurations for the project. Input the following values:

- **Language**: C#

    ![Select language](images/select-language.png)

- **.NET runtime**: .NET 6 (LTS)
    ![Select runtime](images/select-runtime.png)

- **Template for first function**: HTTP trigger

    ![Select template](images/select-template.png)

- **Function name**: HttpTriggerFunction

    ![Select name](images/select-name.png)

- **Namespace**: LearningFunctions.HttpTriggerFunction

    ![Select namespace](images/select-namespace.png)

- **Access rights**: Anonymous

   ![Select access rights](images/select-accessrights.png)

Your project and first function is now being set up and a number of files will be created in the folder. 


### The project files

Your workshop folder should look like this

![Generated project files](images/project-files.png)

A number of files are generated, for the most part they will be left as is, but there are two files you will need to edit. 

- `local.settings.json` holds the settings for running the function locally and you will be updating this later in the workshop. 

- `HttpTriggerFunction.cs` contains the function.

```cs
[FunctionName("HttpTriggerFunction")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
    string name = req.Query["name"];
    string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
    name = name ?? data?.name;
    string responseMessage = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
        ? "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
        : $"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";
    return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
}
```


The functions first input parameter has an attribute `[HttpTrigger(...)]` that specifies that the function response to an `http trigger`.

The function supports both `HTTP GET` and `HTTP POST` requests, no authorization is required and no route is defined. 
The input is an `HttpRequest` object and an `ILogger` object.

Each time the function is triggered, a text string is written to the console and a text string is returned to the client.

**Question**

Which text string will appear in the console and which text string will appear in the browser? 

Not quite sure? Go on to the next step to find out!


### Run the template project
The auto created function is ready to run as is, let's test that everything is set up ok. 

1. Open a new terminal in VS Code 
2. Navigate to the project folder and run cmd `func start`

If everything is successful the output in the terminal should look like this

   ![http-func-terminal](images/http-func-terminal.png)

Navigate to the url displayed in the terminal to see your function.


### Modifying the HTTP trigger function

Run the cmd `func start` after each step to see the results.

1. Hard coded response.

    In the case no name is passed to the function, change the text in the response from 
    `This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.` 
    to `Welcome to my first Azure Function!`

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/HttpTriggerFunction/ModifyHttpTrigger/hardcodedResponse)

2. Accessing query parameters

    The function template retrieves a single query parameter _name_. 
    Can you extend the function to process two query parameters `name` and `company`? 
    
    Use the parameters to print a response to the user in the following format:
    
    `Hello, [name]. Are you ready for this workshop with [company]?`

    _Hint_: To send a query parameter to the function add `?{parameterName}={parameterValue}` at the end of the url. E.g. `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTriggerFunction?company=Avanade` If you want to send multiple parameters separate them with `&`.

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/HttpTriggerFunction/ModifyHttpTrigger/accessQueryParam)    

3. Returning dynamic data

    Instead of printing a hard coded string, can you make the function return the current time? 

    _Hint_: In C#, the DateTime object is defined in the `System` namespace. To get the current date use `System.DateTime.Now`.

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/HttpTriggerFunction/ModifyHttpTrigger/dynamicResponse)    


**Question**
During the configuration of the function we set the access rights to `anonymous`.
Other available options are `Function` and `Admin` when would you use these two configurations? 

## Task 2 - Creating an Azure Function with a Cosmos DB trigger

In this and future tasks, you will be working with a [website for rating pizza](https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net/). The site collects ratings for various pizzas and users can give a score from 0 to 4. The ratings are stored in an Azure Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development.

![website overview](images/website-overview.png)    



![rating](images/rating.png)    


Your task will be to create an Azure Function that is triggered each time a new rating is given on the site. This can be done using a Azure function with a Cosmos DB trigger.

For the purpose of this workshop, each instance of the site stores the ratings in a separate collection in Cosmos DB. This way, you can test you function by adding a rating to the site, and it only triggers your function.

Your individual resources will be identified by using the GUID displayed in the top right corner of the website. 

![guid](images/guid.png)    

Keep this GUID handy and insert it everywhere in the description where `[INSERT GUID]` is mentioned.

### Create a new Azure Function

1. In VS Code, under the `Workspace` section of the Azure extension, select `Add` and `Create Function`.

![Create project](images/add-in-azure-extension.png)

You will now be prompted for configurations for the project and login to Azure. Input the following values:

[TODO: go through steps and confirm what needs to be selected]
[Note: Could we have a file ready for them where they only need to replace certain parts of the code? ]
- **Template for function**: Azure Cosmos DB trigger

- **Function name**: CosmosTriggerFunction

- **Namespace**: LearningFunctions.CosmosTriggerFunction

- **Insert info about storage**;

- **Settings from `local.settings.json`**: + Create new local app setting and Skip for now

- **Select subscription**: Select your available subscription.

- **Select database account**: Skip for now

- **Database name**: storage

- **Collection name**: ratings_[INSERT GUID] e.g. `ratings_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d`

- **Storage account prompt**: Use local emulator

    ![Prompt](images/storage-prompt.png)

Your function is now being set up and a file `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs` will be added to your folder.

### Complete setup of function

1. Set connection string in `local.settings.json`

    Open file add a new setting to the `Values` section

    ```json
    "CosmosConnection": "AccountEndpoint=https://abakus-workshop.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=XnSfxZw1Npwzw5oDg1OvIDzBpX8h9KirkDLTsghy7myFCyW3YmOdyVIIyB0bINwmQju0UxIE6aN7C8CKhNK05w==;"
    ```

2. Complete the trigger configuration in `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs`

    The `Run` function has a configuration for the Cosmos DB trigger,
    but it is not yet complete. 

    ```cs
    [CosmosDBTrigger(
            databaseName: "storage",
            collectionName: "ratings_[INSERT GUID]", // insert your guid here
            ConnectionStringSetting = "",
            LeaseCollectionName = "leases")]
    ```

    - Ensure that database name is set to `storage`, and that the collection name is set to `ratings_[GUID]`.

    - The value of `ConnectionStringSetting` should be `"CosmosConnection"`. This refers to the value that was included in local.settings.json

    - Change  the value of `LeaseCollectionName` from _leases_ to `"leases_[GUID]"` Remember to insert your custom guid.

    The fully configured attribute should look like this
    "
    ```cs
    [CosmosDBTrigger(
            databaseName: "storage",
            collectionName: "ratings_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d",
            ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosConnection",
            LeaseCollectionName = "leases_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d")]
    ```
   

3. Add rating model class to be used by the function

    In `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs`, replace the class `MyDocument` with the model for rating

    ```cs
    public class Rating
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }

        public int PizzaId { get; set; }

        public int Score { get; set; }

        public DateTime Created { get; set; }
    }
    ```

    and change type for input from `IReadOnlyList<MyDocument>` to `IReadOnlyList<Rating>` 

4. Run the function

    Your function should now be ready to go and you can run it by typing the cmd `func start` in the terminal.

    Each time a rating is given on the web site, you should see activity in your console.

**Question**

The template function only accesses the first element in the input collection. In what cases would the collection hold more than one element?

### Modify Cosmos DB Trigger function

1. Ensure that all changes to the ratings results in a log line in the console. 
  
    _Hint_: Try looping through the input collection with a _ForEach_ loop.

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/logAllChanges)    

2. Print the content of the rating in the console. 

    To convert the input object to a rating element by casting it.
    
    ```cs
    Rating r = (Rating) input[i];
    ```

    _Hint_: Use System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer to serialize the rating object to a json string.

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/printContent)    
    
3. Print a different string to the console depending of the score of the rating. 

    _Hint_: Use a switch case.

  [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/printStringBasedOnScore)    


## Task 3 - Creating an Azure Function with a timer trigger
Another use case for Azure Functions is when you have a job that needs to run on a schedule. Once a week, once a month og even once every five minutes. In this task, you are to create a function that prints a summary of the ratings on the pizza site every 5 minute.

### Setup trigger

1. Using the same project as previous steps: navigate to the Azure functions extension and click the "Create new function.." button

![Timer trigger creation](images/create_timer_trigger.png)

1. When prompted for configurations enter:

    Template for function:  **TimerTrigger**

    Name: **ScheduledJob**

    Namespace: **LearningFunctions.TimerTrigger**

    Cron Expression (every 5 minute): __0 */5 * * * *__

2. If prompted to create a storage account when debugging, click "**use local emulator**"

The timer trigger is now generated in your solution folder in "ScheduledJob.cs": 

```csharp
[Function("ScheduledJob")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")] MyInfo myTimer, FunctionContext context)
{
    var logger = context.GetLogger("ScheduledJob");
    logger.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
    logger.LogInformation($"Next timer schedule at: {myTimer.ScheduleStatus.Next}");
}
```

### Testing TimerTrigger

To test the function, run `func start` from cmd / terminal in the solution folder. The output should 

### Code to get summary from api:

```csharp
[FunctionName("ScheduledJob")]
public static async Task Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
    var endpoint = "https://apipizza.azurewebsites.net/ratings/ab2a204f-c5f1-424b-85e2-d8d7ac4730cc";
    var httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var result = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(endpoint + "?min=5");

    log.LogInformation($"Result: {result}");
}
```

(Replace {sessionCode} in the endpoint variable with your session code from [https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net/](https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net//))

### Modify timer function

5 minutes is a long time to wait for your function to trigger. Are you abel to modify the cron job to trigger every 5 second?

## Task 4 - Deploying the functions to Azure
Until now you have been running the functions locally. This step describes how deploy the function to Azure.

![Create Azure function app in Azure](images/create-azure-function.png)

When prompted to configure your function select:

1. **Create new function app in Azure..**
2. Name: **Pick a globally unique name**
3. Runtime stack: **.NET 6**
4. Location: **Norway East**


Once the creation process is complete you should be able see your newly created function app in the [azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites/kind/functionapp).

**Deploy the code to your newly created function app**
![Deploy project to azure funciton app](images/deploy.png)


### Trigger functions / logs in Azure portals

In order to trigger a function navigate to the trigger:

![Select trigger](images/select_trigger.png)

Then click "Code + Test"

From the "Code + Test" view you can trigger functions (1) and see live logs(2).
